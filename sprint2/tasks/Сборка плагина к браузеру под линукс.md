## Environment Setup

- [x]  **Document environment setup**
    - [x]  Define Go toolchain requirements (`go version >= 1.18`).
    - [x]  Install cross-compilation tools (`gcc`, `libc-dev`, `linux-headers`).
    - [ ]  Verify dependencies for hardware access (`libusb`, `udev`, etc.).
- [x]  **Set up the project directory structure**
    - [x]  Create directories for plugin logic, tests, and scripts (`src/`, `tests/`, `scripts/`).

---

## Core Development

- [ ]  **Enable and test native calls**
    - [x]  Investigate and configure Go bindings for COM port communication.
    - [ ]  Write integration wrappers using `cgo` for hardware-level functions.
    - [ ]  Implement permission checks for file system access.
- [ ]  **Review and refactor plugin API**
    - [ ]  Confirm alignment with browser extension APIs.
    - [ ]  Add structured logging for debugging (`logrus` or `zap`).

---

## Build and Automation

- [ ]  **Write build scripts**
    - [x]  Create `Makefile` for standardized tasks (build, test, clean).
    - [ ]  Automate cross-platform builds (`linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`).
    - [ ]  Verify use of `LD_FLAGS` to embed versioning and metadata into the binary.
- [ ]  **Integrate CI/CD pipelines**
    - [ ]  Configure GitHub Actions for automated builds.
    - [ ]  Add a step for uploading binaries to a release repository.
    - [ ]  Test deployment scripts for various Linux distributions.

---

## Testing and Debugging

- [ ]  **Unit and integration tests**
    - [x]  Write unit tests for file operations (`os` package mocking).
    - [ ]  Develop integration tests for COM port communication.
    - [ ]  Validate user permission handling using sandboxed environments.
- [ ]  **Debug tools**
    - [x]  Set up `delve` for debugging.
    - [ ]  Add dynamic environment-specific logging for native code (`debug_utils_linux.go`).
    - [ ]  Test alternative `ExecCommand` logic for subprocess management (resolve `CombineOutput` limitations).
- [ ]  **Edge-case handling**
    - [ ]  Simulate incorrect configurations to ensure resilience.
    - [ ]  Validate error codes for compliance with POSIX standards.

---

## Documentation and Packaging

- [ ]  **User documentation**
    - [ ]  Create `docs/user-manual.md` for plugin usage and permissions.
    - [ ]  Include example configurations for common Linux distros.
    - [ ]  Add a section on cryptographic signing for the plugin.
- [ ]  **Release packaging**
    - [ ]  Ensure `README.md` is included in the binary package.
    - [ ]  Add `.desktop` files and ensure proper system integration.
    - [ ]  Verify the plugin complies with Linux sandboxing policies.

---

## Final Review and Cleanup

- [ ]  **Code review**
    - [ ]  Consolidate and prepare commits for review.
    - [ ]  Run static analysis (`staticcheck`, `golangci-lint`) to identify issues.
    - [ ]  Remove debug flags and unnecessary logging from production builds.
- [ ]  **Documentation sync**
    - [ ]  Migrate Sphinx docs into the main repository for better collaboration.
    - [ ]  Document certificate usage for secured communication.

---

## Optional Enhancements

- [ ]  Add support for additional communication protocols (e.g., MQTT, WebSockets).
- [ ]  Explore making debug dependencies (`debug_utils_linux.go`) conditionally included for build profiles.
- [ ]  Plan a future-proof architecture for Crypto DSS functionality.
